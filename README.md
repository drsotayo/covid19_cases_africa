Data Analysis and Visualisation of Covid-19 Cases in Africa using Python 

The exercise focusses on Africa and analyses the following using the dataset provided by the WHO:

• Rank the Covid-19 cases in Africa (i.e. most cases to least cases, top (3) and bottom (3) African countries)

• Distribution of cases (per 100,000 population) for each African country 

• Visualise the data using bar charts and interactive maps 

• Evaluate some descriptive statistics (e.g. Mean, Median)

• Utilise pandas, matplotlib and plotly libraries for data analysis and visualisation
